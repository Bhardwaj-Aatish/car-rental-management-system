We've   designed  a web-based system that  allows the  customers to register and reserve cars online and for the car rental company or car owners to effectively manage their car rental business .

Car Rental System and the database  works on a server that are always online. A custmors can access our system
with any internet browser.Thus makes the overall car rental  work easily accessible and reliable.

For designing the layout of our website we've use  HTML,CSS,JS and 
we've used  nodejs for developing our server and phpmyAdmin for managing the database 
First we've made the use case diagram that shows hows the users and organization  interacts with the system.
Based upon that  we've made the logical model called the  ER digram , defining  various entities and their necessary attributes.
For example entities like customers,rent,Car,location etc. 
after this we've  established relations between these entities such as 
car to location,customers to car to rent, etc  
Then based on that we've constructed our final relational schema using phpmyAdmin and this we've connected this data 
base with our fronted .
